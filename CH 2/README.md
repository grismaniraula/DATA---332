If you give qplot two vectors of equal lengths, qplot will draw a scatterplot for you. qplot will use the first vector as a set of x values and the second vector as a set of y values.

Scatterplots are useful for visualizing the relationship between two variables. However, weâ€™re going to use a different type of graph, a histogram. A histogram visualizes the distribution of a single variable; it displays how many data points appear at each value of x. This plot shows that our vector contains one value in the interval [1, 2) by placing a bar of height 1 above that interval. Similarly, the plot shows that the vector contains three values in the interval [2, 3) by placing a bar of height 3 in that interval. It shows that the vector contains two values in the interval [3, 4) by placing a bar of height 2 in that interval. In these intervals, the hard bracket, [, means that the first number is included in the interval. The parenthesis, ), means that the last number is not included.

There are five points with a value of 1 in the plot below. The histogram displays this by plotting a bar of height 5 above the interval x2 = [1, 2):. 

![PLOT 3](https://github.com/grismaniraula/DATA-332/assets/118494102/a780be21-4294-45d1-856b-df82a5646bde)

This histogram looks like a symmetric pyramid. The middle bar has a height of 3 and appears above [2, 3).

This results suggest that the dice are fair. Over the long run, each number occurs in proportion to the number of combinations that generate it. 6 occurs more often than any other number, and frequencies diminish in proportion to the number of die combinations that create each number.
